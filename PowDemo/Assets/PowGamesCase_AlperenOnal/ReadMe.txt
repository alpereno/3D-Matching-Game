What we want in this project ?

- Firstly complete the basic game mechanics
  - Cube spawn system (Sample 4x4x4)
  - Rotate cubes by mouse or touch inputs
  - Match area (allow max 7 objects)
  - Matching when 3 same cubes come together. (Similar cubes are placed in between and others are shifted)

- Extras
  - Undo Power Up (Move the last object on the match area to its original position)
  - Hint Power Up (Find other matches of the object in the slot. Match 3 similar cubes if the slot is empty)
  - Star System (Give stars every matching)
  - Combo System (Increase the amount of combo as you matching them one after the other. Stars are earned as the amount of combo)
  - Adjust the scene view for different screen resolutions

Focus on code quality and project hierarchy instead of writing too many features
Create new public github repository and commit all project changes step by step.
